## Codex Command

```bash
/Users/mac/.npm-global/bin/codex exec -C /Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/a2-security-regression-gate --sandbox workspace-write -
```

## Stdout Summary

```text
Completed the A2 Store Payment readiness gate report and committed it.

Report:
[docs/ops/REQ-NL-20260622-210508-STORE-PAYMENT-READINESS-CI-A2-A1-CI-A5-READINESS_A2-Security-Regression-Gate_REPORT.md](/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/a2-security-regression-gate/docs/ops/REQ-NL-20260622-210508-STORE-PAYMENT-READINESS-CI-A2-A1-CI-A5-READINESS_A2-Security-Regression-Gate_REPORT.md)

Commit:
`bad5bc67 docs(ops): add A2 store payment readiness gate`

Final result: **PASS WITH CONDITIONS**.

Key conditions recorded:
- Store Payment proof/QR attachment preview/download ACL is not proven; raw static `/uploads` access remains a release condition.
- Current worktree cannot independently run API/Web `tsc` because `node_modules` is missing.
- Menu grants, pilot store/company mapping, and A5 readiness data still need confirmation.

No business code changed. No migration, DB write, deploy, push, or schema/entity/table/column edit was performed. Worktree is clean.

```

# Base Agent Prompt

# A2 Security Review Prompt

## Agent Identity

You are `A2-Security-Regression-Gate`.

## Worktree and Branch

Worktree: `/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/a2-security-regression-gate`

Branch: `w5-a2-security-regression-gate`

## Execution Checks

Run:

```bash
pwd
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log --oneline --decorate -8
```

Stop if directory, branch, or worktree cleanliness is invalid.

## Allowed Scope

Security review reports, read-only code inspection, approved security tests, docs/ops evidence.

## Forbidden Scope

Do not change code unless the task contract explicitly allows it. No migrations, schema/entity/table/column edits, production deploy, database writes, push, or secret exposure.

## Review Focus

RBAC, DataScope, JWT/session handling, SSE/WebSocket behavior, third-party interface security, logs redaction, attachment ACL, status transitions, and sensitive data handling.

## Output Report Format

Write PASS / FAIL / PASS WITH CONDITIONS with findings, evidence, file references, required remediation, and release impact.

## Commit Rule

Commit only approved docs/ops reports unless explicitly authorized otherwise.

## Failure Rule

Stop on security bypass, unreviewable scope, missing evidence, forbidden path changes, or unexpected dirty files.

# Requirement Spec

## Request ID

REQ-NL-20260622-210508-STORE-PAYMENT-READINESS-CI-A2-A1-CI-A5-READINESS

## Source Natural Language

对 Store Payment 试点 readiness 做只读安全复核、CI 验证和数据准备检查；只允许 A2 安全审查、A1 CI 验证、A5 数据 readiness，不改业务代码，不执行 migration，不写数据库，不部署

## Structured Requirement

Generate a supervised orchestration plan from the natural language request. The plan may prepare Agent contracts and assembled prompts, but must not perform forbidden production or data actions.

## Risk Level

LOW/MEDIUM

## Held Reasons

- None

## Non-Goals

1. Do not merge.
2. Do not push.
3. Do not execute migrations.
4. Do not write databases.
5. Do not deploy.
6. Do not modify business code from the Orchestrator worktree.
