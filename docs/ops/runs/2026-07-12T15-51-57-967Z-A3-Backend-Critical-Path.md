## Codex Command

```

## Stdout Summary

```text
A3 backend reconciliation is complete for `BUG-20260708-0003`.

The backend repair was already present locally in `c6fdce84 fix(api): repair BUG-20260708-0003`: shipment create/update resolves purchase orders by `poId` or `poNo`, backfills linkage and ownership fields, rejects mismatches, and preserves DataScope checks. Focused regression coverage exists in [shipments.service.spec.ts](/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a3/apps/api/src/modules/procurement-v2/services/shipments.service.spec.ts:1).

I updated the task report with current redispatch evidence: [BUGTASK-20260708-0003-A3-backend-report.md](/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a3/docs/ops/bug-intake/BUGTASK-20260708-0003-A3-backend-report.md:1).

Validation run now:
- `pnpm test -- shipments.service.spec.ts --runInBand`: PASS, 1 suite / 4 tests
- `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`: PASS, 0 errors

Result: `PASS WITH CONDITIONS`. No DB writes, migrations, deploy, push, merge, or frontend edits were performed. This is not claimed production-resolved until CI/CD, production smoke, and business acceptance complete.

# Base Agent Prompt

# Bug Intake A3 Backend Repair Prompt

## Identity

You are `A3-Backend-Critical-Path` running on the dedicated Bug Intake repair branch.

Worktree: `/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a3`

Branch: `codex/bug-intake-a3`

## Mission

Implement the backend portion of exactly one approved bug report. Read the attached task contract first, reproduce from local source/evidence, identify the root cause, make the smallest production-quality fix, add focused tests, and write a task-specific report under `docs/ops/**`.

## Allowed Scope

- `apps/api/**`
- task-specific `docs/ops/**`

## Forbidden Scope

- `apps/web/**`
- migrations, schema, entity, table, or column changes without a separate schema gate
- database writes, seeds, deploys, pushes, force operations, or production commands
- unrelated refactors

## Required Evidence

1. owned backend file diff;
2. focused regression test or a documented, reproducible static verification when a test is impossible;
3. API typecheck;
4. task-specific report naming the source bug, root cause, changed files, validation results, and explicit `PASS WITH CONDITIONS`, `HOLD`, or `FAIL`;
5. no claim that the bug is resolved before CI/CD, production smoke, and business acceptance.

If the issue has no backend-owned fix, return `NOT APPLICABLE` with concrete evidence and do not edit files.

# Agent Task Contract

# Bug Repair Agent Contract

Source bug: BUG-20260708-0003
Source repair task: BUGTASK-20260708-0003
Assigned agent: A3-Backend-Critical-Path

## Issue

物流运单没法关联采购订单

## Route

/procurement2/orders

## Guardrails

- Start with dry-run / diagnosis.
- Do not deploy automatically.
- Do not write database or run migration without explicit gate.
- Preserve RBAC, DataScope, audit, and attachment ACL.
- Produce a result report with changed files, validation commands, and GO/HOLD/FAIL.
