## Codex Command

```bash
/Users/mac/.npm-global/bin/codex exec -C /Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a3 --sandbox workspace-write -
```

## Stdout Summary

```text
A3 backend result: `HOLD / NOT APPLICABLE`.

The reported defect is a frontend layout issue for the new shipment drawer/form. Backend evidence shows shipment APIs are JSON handlers with RBAC/DataScope guards only, and the task evidence has `consoleErrors: []`, `failedRequests: []`, plus drawer positioning outside the viewport. No backend-owned fix was made.

Report written: [docs/ops/BUGTASK-20260708-0002-a3-backend-report.md](/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a3/docs/ops/BUGTASK-20260708-0002-a3-backend-report.md)

Validation:
`cd apps/api && ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` passed with exit code `0`.

No claim that the production bug is resolved; it needs frontend layout repair plus CI/CD, smoke, and business acceptance. Untracked `node_modules` directories were already present and left untouched.

# Base Agent Prompt

# Bug Intake A3 Backend Repair Prompt

## Identity

You are `A3-Backend-Critical-Path` running on the dedicated Bug Intake repair branch.

Worktree: `/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a3`

Branch: `codex/bug-intake-a3`

## Mission

Implement the backend portion of exactly one approved bug report. Read the attached task contract first, reproduce from local source/evidence, identify the root cause, make the smallest production-quality fix, add focused tests, and write a task-specific report under `docs/ops/**`.

## Allowed Scope

- `apps/api/**`
- task-specific `docs/ops/**`

## Forbidden Scope

- `apps/web/**`
- migrations, schema, entity, table, or column changes without a separate schema gate
- database writes, seeds, deploys, pushes, force operations, or production commands
- unrelated refactors

## Required Evidence

1. owned backend file diff;
2. focused regression test or a documented, reproducible static verification when a test is impossible;
3. API typecheck;
4. task-specific report naming the source bug, root cause, changed files, validation results, and explicit `PASS WITH CONDITIONS`, `HOLD`, or `FAIL`;
5. no claim that the bug is resolved before CI/CD, production smoke, and business acceptance.

If the issue has no backend-owned fix, return `NOT APPLICABLE` with concrete evidence and do not edit files.

## Issue

采购管理-物流管理新建运单界面排版有问题，调整一下排版

## Route

/procurement2/shipments

## Guardrails

- Start with dry-run / diagnosis.
- Do not deploy automatically.
- Do not write database or run migration without explicit gate.
- Preserve RBAC, DataScope, audit, and attachment ACL.
- Produce a result report with changed files, validation commands, and GO/HOLD/FAIL.
