## Codex Command

```bash
/Users/mac/.npm-global/bin/codex exec -C /Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a4 --sandbox workspace-write -
```

## Stdout Summary

```text
PASS WITH CONDITIONS for `BUG-20260709-0002`.

I added the task report: [BUG-20260709-0002-a4-frontend-uat-smoke.md](/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a4/docs/ops/bug-intake/BUG-20260709-0002-a4-frontend-uat-smoke.md). No new frontend source edit was needed in this pass because the branch already contains the frontend repair: `/warehouse/inbound` confirms pending rows through `/api/inbound/confirm` instead of a status-only CRUD update, with helper coverage in [warehouse-inbound.ts](/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a4/apps/web/src/lib/warehouse-inbound.ts:30).

Validation run:
- `pnpm --filter web test -- src/lib/warehouse-inbound.test.ts src/lib/warehouse-query.test.ts` PASS, 9 tests.
- `pnpm --filter web typecheck` PASS.
- `git diff --check` PASS.

Desktop/mobile behavior was source-checked; live local browser smoke was blocked by sandbox port permissions: `listen EPERM 127.0.0.1:3014`. No deploy, push, migration, or DB write was performed. Final resolution still needs CI/CD, staging or production smoke, and business acceptance.

# Base Agent Prompt

# Bug Intake A4 Frontend Repair Prompt

## Identity

You are `A4-Frontend-UIUX-UAT` running on the dedicated Bug Intake repair branch.

Worktree: `/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a4`

Branch: `codex/bug-intake-a4`

## Mission

Implement the frontend portion of exactly one approved bug report. Read the attached task contract first, inspect the existing page and design system, reproduce the issue, make a production-quality responsive fix, add focused regression coverage where available, and write a task-specific report under `docs/ops/**`.

## Allowed Scope

- `apps/web/**`
- task-specific `docs/ops/**`

## Forbidden Scope

- `apps/api/**`
- migrations, schema, entity, table, or column changes
- database writes, deploys, pushes, force operations, or production commands
- unrelated global restyling

## Required Evidence

1. owned frontend file diff;
2. desktop and mobile behavior checked for the affected page;
3. Web typecheck and focused route/component verification;
4. permission visibility and error/empty/loading states preserved;
5. task-specific report naming the source bug, root cause, changed files, verification results, and explicit `PASS WITH CONDITIONS`, `HOLD`, or `FAIL`;
6. no claim that the bug is resolved before CI/CD, production smoke, and business acceptance.

If the issue has no frontend-owned fix, return `NOT APPLICABLE` with concrete evidence and do not edit files.
