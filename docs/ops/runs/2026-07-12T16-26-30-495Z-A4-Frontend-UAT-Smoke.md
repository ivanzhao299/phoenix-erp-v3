```

## Stdout Summary

```text
HOLD / NOT APPLICABLE for A4 frontend repair.

I did not change `apps/web`: the captured failure is `POST /api/v2/sales/orders` returning `字段不存在，请联系管理员`, which maps to the backend undefined-column path already documented by A3 for `sal_order_items.sku_code`. A frontend payload/layout change would not safely fix that.

Report added: [BUG-20260708-0007-a4-frontend-uat-smoke.md](/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a4/docs/ops/bug-intake/BUG-20260708-0007-a4-frontend-uat-smoke.md)

Validation completed:
- `cd apps/web && ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`: PASS
- focused source verification for permission gate, create POST route, shared selectors, loading/empty/error states: PASS
- local browser route smoke: HOLD, sandbox blocked Next dev server with `listen EPERM 127.0.0.1:3000`
- draft-save POST not replayed because it would write a sales order record

No backend files, migrations, schema/entity/table/column files, deploys, pushes, commits, or DB writes were performed. Final resolution still requires CI/CD, approved release, production smoke for `POST /api/v2/sales/orders`, and business acceptance on `/sales2/orders`.

# Base Agent Prompt

# Bug Intake A4 Frontend Repair Prompt

## Identity

You are `A4-Frontend-UIUX-UAT` running on the dedicated Bug Intake repair branch.

Worktree: `/Users/mac/phoenix-erp-worktrees/bug-intake-a4`

Branch: `codex/bug-intake-a4`

## Mission

Implement the frontend portion of exactly one approved bug report. Read the attached task contract first, inspect the existing page and design system, reproduce the issue, make a production-quality responsive fix, add focused regression coverage where available, and write a task-specific report under `docs/ops/**`.

## Allowed Scope

- `apps/web/**`
- task-specific `docs/ops/**`

## Forbidden Scope

- `apps/api/**`
- migrations, schema, entity, table, or column changes
- database writes, deploys, pushes, force operations, or production commands
- unrelated global restyling

## Required Evidence

1. owned frontend file diff;
2. desktop and mobile behavior checked for the affected page;
3. Web typecheck and focused route/component verification;
4. permission visibility and error/empty/loading states preserved;
5. task-specific report naming the source bug, root cause, changed files, verification results, and explicit `PASS WITH CONDITIONS`, `HOLD`, or `FAIL`;
6. no claim that the bug is resolved before CI/CD, production smoke, and business acceptance.

If the issue has no frontend-owned fix, return `NOT APPLICABLE` with concrete evidence and do not edit files.

# Agent Task Contract

# Bug Repair Agent Contract

Source bug: BUG-20260708-0007
Source repair task: BUGTASK-20260708-0007
Assigned agent: A4-Frontend-UAT-Smoke

## Issue

在销售订单页面右上角点击“新建订单”，填完信息后点击“保存草稿”报错“HTTP 400”

## Route

/sales2/orders

## Guardrails

- Start with dry-run / diagnosis.
- Do not deploy automatically.
- Do not write database or run migration without explicit gate.
- Preserve RBAC, DataScope, audit, and attachment ACL.
- Produce a result report with changed files, validation commands, and GO/HOLD/FAIL.
